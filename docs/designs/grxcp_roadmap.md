# GRXCP Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Planning document.
**Companions:** [`grxcp_architecture.md`](grxcp_architecture.md),
[`cuda_mapping.md`](cuda_mapping.md).

Effort figures are engineer-month estimates for a small senior team and are
planning aids, not commitments. Every phase ends with a gate that can be
objectively passed or failed; a phase is not "done" because its code exists.

 Parallel track: ISA RFC — WSHFL warp shuffle (GRX-G100 repo)
                 → unblocks the fast path in P2/P3, not their correctness
```

Two phases depend on work in the **GRX-G100 repo**, not GRXCP:

| GRXCP need | GRX-G100 item | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Real stream concurrency (P5) | QMD-style atomic `CMD_LAUNCH` + multi-queue | `command_processor.md` §10 items 5–6 |
| Device-side event timing (P5) | CP profiling writeback | §10 item 9 |
| Managed memory on FPGA (P6) | `CP_SATP` decode + HW page-table walker | §10 item 2 |
| Safe unaligned `grxMemcpy` on FPGA (P1 mitigation removal) | tail `wstrb` in `VX_cp_dma` | §10 item 1 |
| Fast warp shuffle (P2 fast path) | `WSHFL` ISA extension | this doc, ISA track |

Start those conversations at P0, not when the phase begins.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations (≈1 engineer-month)

**Scope.** Repository, build system, CI skeleton, and one end-to-end signal
of life. No API surface yet.

- CMake build that discovers the GRX-G100 sysroot through
  `pkg-config vortex-runtime vortex-kernel` — never `$VORTEX_HOME`.
- `AGENTS.md` and the docs set (this file and its companions).
- CI catalog in the same YAML shape as `grxgpu/ci/testcases/`, running on
  `simx` and `rtlsim`.
- `grx-smi` v0: open every device, dump all 18 `vx_device_query` capability
  IDs, print backend and ISA flags.

**Exit gate.** `grx-smi` prints correct, non-fabricated device properties on
both `simx` and `rtlsim`, in CI, from a clean checkout.

**Status.**

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Repository, `AGENTS.md`, design docs | done |
| CMake build with pkg-config sysroot discovery | done |
| CI catalog (`ci/testcases/grxcp.yaml`) | done |
| Runtime device layer (`src/runtime/{internal.h,error.cpp,context.cpp}`) | done |
| `grx-smi` v0 (human + `--json`) | done |
| Mock driver fixture + unit tests + `ci/build_mock.sh` (tier 1) | done |
| Exit gate: `grx-smi` on real `simx` / `rtlsim` (tier 2) | **blocked on an installed GRX-G100 sysroot** |

Tier-1 CI passes: the runtime compiles, links, and reports a self-consistent
device record against the mock driver, including the FPGA managed-memory gate
and the honesty-flag contract. That proves the code is not broken; it proves
nothing about hardware. The gate is a tier-2 result and needs
`$VORTEX_PATH` pointing at a `make install`-ed GRX-G100 tree.

**Why first.** It proves the sysroot contract works and gives every later
phase a place to land. It also surfaces build-integration problems while
they are cheap.

---

## Phase 1 — Runtime API v1 (≈3–4 engineer-months)

**Scope.** `libgrxrt` with the full L1 C API, on the existing SPIR-V
toolchain. Kernels are launched with explicit `grxLaunchKernel`; `<<<>>>`
waits for Phase 4.

- Device management, implicit context, `grxDeviceProp_t` from real caps.
- Two-tier slab allocator with the interval map; `grxMalloc`/`Free`/
  `MallocHost`/`MallocManaged` (gated on `VX_CAPS_VM_SUPPORT`).
- `grxMemcpy` family including 2D/3D → `vx_enqueue_*_rect`; `grxMemset`.
- Streams over `vx_queue_h`, including null-stream semantics.
- Events over `vx_event_h` timelines; `grxEventElapsedTime` with the host
  fallback and the honest `eventTimingIsDeviceSide` flag.
- Module/kernel handles; `grxLaunchKernel` → `vx_launch_info_t`.
- Occupancy API using the documented slot formula.
- FPGA safety mitigation: 64-byte allocation padding while
  `VX_cp_dma`'s tail-`wstrb` gap is open.
- Conformance harness: the CUDA sample corpus subset, compiled through
  `grx_cuda_compat.h`, with a **published pass rate**.

**Exit gate.** `vecadd` and `sgemm` written against the GRXCP runtime API
produce numerically correct results on `simx` **and** `rtlsim`; the
allocator survives a fragmentation stress test; the conformance harness runs
and reports a number.

**Risk.** The SPIR-V path constrains what kernels can express. Do not fight
it here — Phase 1's job is the host runtime, not kernel expressiveness.

**Status.**

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Device management, implicit context, `grxDeviceProp_t` | done (phase 0) |
| Two-tier slab allocator + interval map | done |
| `grxMalloc` / `Free` / `MallocHost` / `MallocManaged` | done |
| `grxMemcpy` family, `grxMemset`, `grxPointerGetAttributes` | done (2D decomposed row-wise; strided descriptors are a follow-up) |
| Streams over `vx_queue_h`, legacy null-stream ordering | done |
| Events over timeline counters, elapsed with host fallback | done |
| Mock driver models memory / queues / events | done |
| Module + kernel handles, `grxLaunchKernel` | **next** |
| Occupancy API | **next** (needs the kernel registry for static shared memory) |
| Conformance harness + published pass rate | **next** |

Three test binaries pass against the mock: `test_device_props`, `test_memory`,
`test_stream_event`. They verify data correctness through real offsets, the
allocator's non-overlap and reuse invariants, direction validation, and the
event/stream error surface. They verify **nothing** about concurrency — the
mock completes every enqueue before returning, so no test here can fail
because of a race. Overlap is a tier-2 property.

---

## Phase 2 — Device programming model and tools baseline (≈3 engineer-months)

**Scope.** The device-side headers and the tools that make the platform
usable by someone who is not on the team.

- `include/grx/device/`: `grx_device.h` (thread/block indices,
  `__syncthreads`, `printf`, `clock64`), `grx_warp.h` (ballot/any/all from
  `vx_active_threads`, plus the **LMEM-staged shuffle fallback**),
  `grx_cg.h` (cooperative groups over the thread mask and `vx_gbar`).
- `grx-prof` v1: kernel timeline from event timestamps, occupancy report,
  MPM stall breakdown, Perfetto export reusing `ci/perfetto.py`.
- `grx-sanitize` v1 on SimX: out-of-bounds global/shared access, use of
  uninitialized shared memory, and barrier-divergence detection.
- `grxify` v0: mechanical `cudaX → grxX` source rewriting.

**Exit gate.** A warp-reduction kernel using `__shfl_down_sync` produces
correct results through the fallback; `grx-sanitize` detects a deliberately
planted out-of-bounds write and reports the source line; `grx-prof` produces
a Perfetto trace a human can read.

**Note.** `grx-sanitize` lands early on purpose. On a functional simulator
it is cheap, and it pays for itself across every later phase by catching the
memory bugs that otherwise burn days in RTL debug.

---

## Phase 3 — grxBLAS v1 and tensor-core exposure (≈4 engineer-months)

**Scope.** The library that justifies the platform, and the first real
collision with the SPIR-V path's limits.

- `grx::wmma` device API over `vortex::tensor::wmma_context` /
  `wgmma_context`: `fragment`, `fill_fragment`, `load_matrix_sync`,
  `mma_sync`, `store_matrix_sync`, plus WGMMA warp-group forms and the 2:4
  sparse variants.
- `grx::pipeline` / `grx::memcpy_async` over `vx_dxa_issue_*_wg` and
  `vx_barrier_expect_tx`.
- grxBLAS v1: GEMM (fp32/fp16/bf16/int8), batched GEMM, GEMV, AXPY, with
  autotuned tile selection seeded from the existing `sgemm_tcu_wg_dxa_mcast`
  reference kernels.

**The structural problem, handled deliberately.** Kernels using TCU/DXA
intrinsics **cannot** go through SPIR-V — the GRX-G100 docs call this out
explicitly. So grxBLAS v1 kernels are compiled with the native VOLT path
directly to `.vxbin` and shipped as prebuilt modules loaded by
`grxModuleLoadData`. This is not a workaround, it is how vendor BLAS
libraries actually ship: precompiled, hand-tuned kernels behind a host API.
It also de-risks Phase 4 by proving the native compile path before `grxcc`
depends on it.

**Exit gate.** `grxblasGemmEx` (fp16 in, fp32 accumulate) reaches within 15%
of the tuned `sgemm_tcu_wg_dxa_mcast` reference on the same configuration,
on `simx` cycle counts, with a passing numerical gate against a CPU
reference.

---

## Phase 4 — `grxcc` single-source driver (≈5–6 engineer-months)

**Scope.** The piece that makes GRXCP a programming platform rather than a
library binding.

- Driver skeleton (orchestrator first — see architecture §11 open question 1):
  split flags, run the device pass through clang + VOLT, run `vxbin.py`, run
  the host pass, link.
- `<<<grid, block, smem, stream>>>` rewriting to
  `__grxPushCallConfiguration` + stub.
- `.grxfat` fat binary emission into `.grxfatbin`;
  `__grxRegisterFatBinary` / `__grxRegisterFunction` constructors.
- Kernel parameter descriptors and the packing ABI — including the **rv32
  pointer-width narrowing** the chipStar path could not fix.
- `__launch_bounds__`, per-kernel register metadata into the `.vxbin`
  footer, which turns `grxFuncGetAttributes.numRegs` from -1 into a number.
- Host target matrix: `x86_64-linux-gnu` and `riscv64-linux-gnu`.

**Exit gate.** A single `.grx.cpp` file containing `__global__` kernels and
`<<<>>>` launches compiles with `grxcc` and runs correctly on `simx` and
`rtlsim`; at least ten CUDA samples compile **unmodified** except for the
`grx_cuda_compat.h` include; the conformance pass rate improves measurably
over Phase 1's published number.

**Risk.** This is the largest single phase and the one most likely to slip.
Mitigation: the orchestrator design means the risk is integration work, not
compiler research — VOLT already lowers SIMT kernels; `vxbin.py` already
builds multi-entry binaries; the CUDA host-side lowering pattern is public
and well understood.

---

## Phase 5 — Concurrency and asynchrony (≈3 engineer-months, gated externally)

**Scope.** Make streams mean something physically.

- Consume the GRX-G100 QMD-style atomic `CMD_LAUNCH` and multi-queue CP work
  (this phase cannot start before that lands).
- Multi-queue stream scheduling in `libgrxrt`; retire the launch
  serialization.
- Device-side event timing once CP profiling writeback exists; drop the host
  clock fallback and flip `eventTimingIsDeviceSide`.
- Copy/compute overlap: `grxMemcpyAsync` on a non-null stream genuinely
  overlapping a kernel on another stream.
- Interrupt-driven completion instead of `Q_SEQNUM` busy-polling, if the
  GRX-G100 interrupt path lands (§10 item 10).

**Exit gate.** A two-stream ping-pong benchmark shows measurable overlap
against the single-stream baseline on `simx` cycle counts, and stream
semantics remain correct under the conformance suite.

---

## Phase 6 — Library breadth and advanced memory (≈6 engineer-months)

**Scope.** Fill out the platform.

- grxDNN (conv2d via implicit GEMM, pooling, softmax, layernorm, GELU,
  fused attention), grxFFT, grxRAND, grxSPARSE, `grx::par`.
- `__constant__` — either the real broadcast path or the documented
  read-only-global lowering, decided by then.
- L1/shared carve-out attribute wired to the DCR, once the G100 unified
  carve-out lands (that project's Phase 2).
- `grx::tex<>` — texture/surface access from compute.
- `grxrtc` runtime compilation.
- Promote `grxcc` to a proper Clang `ToolChain`.

**Exit gate.** A transformer inference workload (attention + GEMM +
layernorm + softmax) runs end-to-end through GRXCP libraries with numerical
agreement against a PyTorch CPU reference; conformance pass rate hits the
target set at Phase 4.

---

## Phase 7 — NPU as a second device, and the native host (≈3 engineer-months)

**Scope.** Deliver on the multi-device promise made in the v1 device model.

- `src/backends/npu_c930/`: device enumeration, capability profile,
  MMIO doorbell driver over the c930 NPU register map
  (`CTRL`/`STATUS`/`DIM_M`/`DIM_N`/`DIM_K`/`A_BASE`/`B_BASE`/`C_BASE`),
  DMA via `c930_npu_dma`, completion via `STATUS.DONE` or the AIA MSI.
- `grxblasGemmEx` routing: INT8 GEMM on an NPU device programs the systolic
  array instead of launching a GPU kernel — same API, different backend.
- `libgrxrt` built and tested natively on `riscv64` running on GRX930.
- Heterogeneous dispatch policy: a documented, explicit rule for which
  engine a library call lands on. Not automatic magic — an explicit
  `grxblasSetPreferredDevice`-style control plus a documented default.

**Exit gate.** The same host program, unchanged, runs an INT8 GEMM on the
GPU device and on the NPU device by changing only `grxSetDevice`, with
matching results; `libgrxrt` passes the conformance suite compiled natively
for riscv64.

---

## Parallel track — `WSHFL` ISA RFC

Not a GRXCP phase; a proposal into the GRX-G100 repo, filed at Phase 0 and
ideally landed before Phase 3.

- **Proposal:** a warp-shuffle instruction with idx / up / down / xor / bfly
  modes, reading the warp's register file through the operand-collector
  crossbar `WGATHER` already uses, generalized beyond 4 lanes.
- **Cost:** RTL + SimX model + a `model_parity` case, plus an area/timing
  study — the register-file crossbar is already flagged as a possible
  bottleneck at 4-way issue (`gpu_chip_design.md` §15 item 5), so this is not
  free.
- **Payoff:** warp reductions and scans stop being an order of magnitude
  slow. This is the single highest-leverage hardware change for CUDA-style
  workload performance.

---

## Risk register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `grxcc` (P4) slips and blocks everything downstream | High | P3 ships prebuilt library kernels via the native VOLT path, so grxBLAS does not wait on `grxcc`; the driver is an orchestrator, not a new frontend |
| Warp shuffle stays emulated | High for perf | Correct fallback ships in P2; RFC filed at P0; perf gate reports emulated-vs-native separately so the cost is visible |
| Stream concurrency (P5) blocked on GRX-G100 CP work | Medium | Phase ordering already assumes it; semantics ship in P1 so no API breaks when it lands |
| FPGA DMA over-write on unaligned copies | Medium, correctness | 64-byte allocation padding from P1 until the tail-`wstrb` fix lands |
| Conformance pass rate is low and demoralizing | Medium | Publish it from P1 and track it as a trend; the chipStar work's ~36% rv32 number is the precedent for honest reporting |
| Scope creep into graphics/ray tracing | Medium | RTU and TEX exposure are explicitly deferred to P6+; GRXCP v1 is compute |
| rv32 doubles the test matrix | Low | rv64 only for v1; rv32 kept compiling, not tested |
| Emulating hardware features silently | High, insidious | Banned by architecture §10 rule 5 — every emulation is reported through a device property |

---

## What "done" means for v1

GRXCP v1 is complete when a developer who knows CUDA can:

1. Write a `.grx.cpp` file with `__global__` kernels and `<<<>>>` launches,
   compile it with `grxcc`, and run it on GRX-G100.
2. Port existing CUDA code by adding one include (`grx_cuda_compat.h`) and
   fixing only the gaps this document names — no mystery failures.
3. Call `grxblasGemmEx` and get tensor-core throughput.
4. Profile with `grx-prof`, debug with `grx-gdb`, and catch memory bugs with
   `grx-sanitize`.
5. Read a published conformance number and know exactly what does and does
   not work.

Phases 0–4 deliver 1, 2, 3 and 4. Phase 6 raises the number in 5. Phase 7
makes it heterogeneous.
